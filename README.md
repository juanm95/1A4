The repo for our force awakening robot

We have a series of folders with incremental updates to our code.
1) CheckOffWednesday - Checking off the sensor and feature integration of the robot
2) Piston - Dispenser testing code
3) ShitAlgorithm - Tests for different features of the robot, not an effective algorithm for gameplay however.
4) BeatTheBrick -The first strafe that was used for checking off
5) BeatTheBrick - Robert's Version - Game Day code
